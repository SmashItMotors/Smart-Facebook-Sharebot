# What makes this bot smart
The part that makes this bot special is its *monitoring and analyzing the post*.
After the making a post in a group, it check the poeple __who all liked the post or are intrested in going to the event__.
This this bot goes tho the facebook profile of those users who have liked or shown intrest in the post and then ***scrapes their details(like their school, their college etc)*** and then based on that data ***join the groups of those schools and colleges*** and hence __keeps on expanding its reach__. 



# Motivation 
Whenever there is an event or some college fest, to promote their event and make its presence online usually organisers ask students to post it on their facebook. Basically tell students to spam of the groups and friends and give awards to people whose account gets blocked by over spamming.This is really inefficient way to doing stuff, hence this motivated us to make smart bot which will do this whole thing automatically and perhaps in a better way.


## What do each file do
* **main.py**   -Initial GUI for the system
* **final.py**  - help in uploading the file and do some basic computation on it.
* **art_group.txt**       -Stores the links of art groups which have accepted us.
* **dance_group.txt**    - Stores the links of all dance groups which have accepted the account which is used to spam.
* **Link_of_all_the_post.txt** - Stores links of all the posts the user has posted.
* **my_file.txt**  - For storing descriptions, tags and path of the file uploaded using the main.py
* **college_of_potential_users.txt** - stores the school and colleges of the students who have liked our posts.
* **input.txt**     - Consist of the link of the id which is used to spam.
* **pending.txt** - List of all the groups which we have send the request to join but are still pending.

## Getting Started 
If you need to create a post then run main.py and fill the details, program will automatically find suitable groups according to the genre of the post specified by the user.


Our programs intelligently find the perfect group match by analyzing the the likes on the previous posts by analyzing the account of the people who have previously liked the post of same genre,finding the groups of their schools and colleges. Hence in the range of bot.
To do this run analize_the_post.py. It will analyse previous post and find the schools and colleges and store it in a file.

Run join_group.py to search and join new groups based on previous analyses and the genre you have entered.

To check it the request sent to the groups to join is approved or not you have to run check_if_group_has_accepted_group_update.py to find the same and update it in the .txt file.
